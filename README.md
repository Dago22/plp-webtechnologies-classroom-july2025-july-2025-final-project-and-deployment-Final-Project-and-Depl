This is a professional, responsive multi-page clothing store demo built with **HTML5**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

## Features
- Multi-page: Home, Products, About, Contact
- Responsive layout (mobile-first friendly)
- Simple product listing, search, sort and demo cart logic
- Clean, modular project structure
- Ready for deployment on GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel

## How to use
1. Extract the files and review the code.
2. Replace images in `/images` with your own product photos (keep file names or update paths).
